## The Poll

Each week we have a tip jar poll. The hope is that we can come up with a question that you want to answer so badly you give us free money. We are hoping this works.

Vote by sending ETH, BTC, or LTC to the address **below** your answer. This week's question is this:

*Is [Craig Wright](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Craig_Steven_Wright) the creator of Bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto?*

- a) No, but I don't have any Bitcoins or Litecoins
<p class="wallet-address"><span class="type">ETH</span> <code>0xd04cE3b302729b3405cB5Bbf3997ec01B4639566</code></p>
- b) We are all Satoshi Nakamoto, except Craig Wright
<p class="wallet-address"><span class="type">BTC</span> <code>??</code></p>
- c) Who? but I am guessing No
<p class="wallet-address"><span class="type">LTC</span> <code>??</code></p>

- These coins demand different kinds of work. Each blockchain has its own purpose. For example, "Bitcoin pays for securing the ledger. Ethereum pays for (executing and verifying) computation." form -> https://hackernoon.com/reflections-on-the-best-blockchain-tweets-ever-written-d488af960d4f actually from (https://twitter.com/naval/status/877470341760598016)

- The economist: https://www.economist.com/news/world-if/21724906-trust-business-little-noticed-huge-startups-deploying-blockchain-technology-threaten "Lists range from simple checklists to complex databases, but they all have one major drawback: we must trust their keepers. Administrators hold the power. They can doctor corporate accounts, delete titles from land registries or add names to party rolls. To stop the keepers from going rogue, and catch them if they do, society has come to rely on all sorts of tools, from audits to supervisory boards. Together, list-keepers and those who watch them form one of the world’s biggest and least noticed industries, the trust business." from that same article...**lets dream of this world**: "In a world run by blockchains, decentralisation could be pushed even further, to include objects. Once they have their own identity and can be controlled via a blockchain, it is possible to imagine them becoming, in a way, self-determining. A few years back, Mike Hearn, a former bitcoin developer who now works for R3, a blockchain consortium, suggested the idea of self-driving cars which are also financially autonomous. Guided by smart contracts, they would stash away some of the digital money they make by ferrying people around, so as to pay for repairs or to replace themselves when repairs are no longer worthwhile. They would put themselves in long-term parking if not enough rides are to be had—or emigrate to another city. They could issue tokens to raise funds and to allow owners to get part of their profits."
